# theDiveClub — status

**The one live list.** What is being built, what is next, what is blocked, and what is waiting on UV. If an outstanding item is tracked anywhere else, that other place is wrong — bring it here and delete it there.

Updated at every milestone, in the same breath as giving UV a commit subject. Never batched to the end of a session.

Last updated: **22 Oct 2026**

**Database is current through `20261022210000`** (leagues steps 1 to 3, pushed 22 Oct), verified against `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`. **`20261023110000_league_entry_fixes.sql` is written and tested but not pushed** (§1). The first contains a **security fix** to a function pushed on 22 Oct — see §1 item 0.

---

## 1. Waiting on UV

Nothing here can be done by Claude.

| | What | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Push `20261023110000_league_entry_fixes.sql`** | Two corrections from UV's 23 Oct test: "paid also confirms" now actually confirms, and an unconfirmed player no longer stops the fixtures being generated. `npx supabase db push --dry-run`, then `db push` |
| 0z | **Push `20261023090000_league_submission.sql`** | Leagues step 5, **and a security fix**: `private.tdc_can_set_lineup` (pushed 22 Oct) returned null rather than false for anybody who captained neither team, and every caller negates it — so a signed-in person outside the league could set another team's lineup and lock it by naming the side. Only an unlocked team match was exposed and production had one league and one match, so nothing is known to have been touched. `npx supabase db push --dry-run`, then `db push` |
| 0a | **Run `supabase/seed/dummy-league-players.sql`** | Nineteen dummy players on your league's interested list, so the confirm boxes have a realistic number in them. Run it in the Supabase SQL editor; Claude did not, because `execute_sql` auto-commits and the rule in START-HERE says it is never used to write. Safe to run twice, and the cleanup block at the bottom removes all of it — **use that block rather than deleting the accounts**, see §6 |
| 0b | **Play a singles match straight after pushing** | `20261022230000` and `20261023090000` both patch **`tdc_record_frame`**, which every match goes through, plus `tdc_submit_card`, `tdc_answer_card` and `private.tdc_card_state`. All changes are additive and covered by new tests — including that a singles card still settles on submission when no approval is wanted, and still waits for an answer when it is — but the original match suites from 15–21 Oct did not survive their container, so a real singles match is the only end-to-end check there is |
| 0c | **Give "Linton's Team" a captain** | In your own league, that team has two players and neither is a captain, so it cannot set a lineup or sign a card by itself. The manage page now says so. Tick Captain beside one of them |
| 0b | **Try the league pages on a phone** | Steps 2 and 3 are pushed and were proven only on a throwaway Postgres driven by headless Chromium. At `/leagues/`: create a league, add a second account, make two teams, confirm as both, generate the fixtures, start a match |
| 1 | **Play through sections 8, 11, 12 and 13 of the test plan** | Several builds are proven only against a scratch database. The logic is verified; a real league night is not |
| 1b | **Try the bracket editor on a real draw** | Insert a prelim, add a match to it, click an arrow to rewire, remove a match. Proven against a scratch database and rendered in headless Chromium; never driven by a person. **Check a tournament with a third-place playoff in particular** — it was broken from 22 Oct until this build and nobody hit it |
| 2 | **Retest the walk-in merge via `/staff/link/`** | The one thing left that could lose real data. Changed again on 21 Oct by the merge fix, so earlier testing no longer counts |
| 3 | **Enable the signup bot check** (Turnstile or hCaptcha) | Self-entry currently rests on a confirmed email address alone. The bot check is the other half of "a verified account" |
| 4 | **Set the black-alpha values** for the refreshed branding | UV sets them himself on `/sandbox/` (palette Depth strengths and the logo controls) and saves them into `variables.css` (22 Oct). Done once he has saved and committed them |

## 2. In progress

| Area | Chat | State |
|---|---|---|
| Leagues | Leagues | **All six steps built.** A league night is playable end to end; standings are the next body of work. Step 1 and its corrections (walk-ins refused, player confirmation, captains control teams) are pushed; steps 2 (the pages) and 3 (round-robin fixtures and the team match) are written, with `200000` and `210000` not yet pushed. Structure: leagues, seasons, teams, entrants, officials; matches get their team keys; the merge fixed. See `CLAUDE.md` → Leagues. Remaining: **LD-configurable standings** — the table a league is actually for. Designed in `docs/design/leagues.md` §6, including the token-array equation format |

---

## 3. Next up

In the order it probably makes sense.

| | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Leagues: standings** | The table a league is for. LD-configurable columns built from a **token array, never a string** — the design is explicit about that and lists the tokens. Designed in `docs/design/leagues.md` §6 |
| 1b | **A player's own frame on `/match/`** | The design's second surface: a player opens the match page and sees only their own frame. `/match/` still refuses a team match, so today a player's frame is entered by their captain on the card. Nothing is blocked by this — it is the convenience half of "two surfaces, one record" |
| 2 | **UV to play through the bracket editor** | Built and render-checked, not yet used on a real draw. See §1 |

---

## 3a. Left to the UI chat

| What | Notes |
|---|---|
| **A player cannot start their own match** | With `create_matches: manual` a player sees their fixture, has no way in, and no explanation. **UV, 22 Oct: a communication problem, to be solved when the rounds are drawn properly with progression arrows** — not a schema gap. The TD already gets a hint |

---

## 4. Wanted, not built

Agreed in principle, nothing written.

| What | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Close a tournament to specific players** | UV, 21 Oct: restricted to a named set, e.g. everyone in a given league. Probably a fourth `entry_mode` value plus an eligibility table, not a separate flag. Interacts with the poster: a restricted tournament may still want a public poster that says "members only" |
| **A live public scoreboard** | Explicitly *not* what the poster is. Needs an `anon` read of live data and therefore the per-function audit the poster design deliberately avoids. Decide on its own merits, do not grow the poster into it |
| **`player_facing` on `TDCMatchDef`** | **Corrected 22 Oct — this does less than it used to say here.** The flag would let the *pages* agree on which settings are player-facing, which is worth having. It would **not** remove `private.tdc_poster_rules`: that runs in SQL, cannot read the JS, and decides what becomes publicly readable, so it has to keep its own list. The real fix for the drift is a check that the two lists agree, not a shared one. Scope it as two jobs, not one |
| **Entry fee charging** | **Blocked** on the credit ledger's `ref_table` / `ref_id`, undecided for travelling leagues |
| **Double elimination, round robin, groups** | Only single elimination generates a draw today |
| **A screen for `tdc_frame_history`** | The audit log is written and queryable with nothing displaying it. **UV, 22 Oct: do it with the match visualisation**, not on its own |
| **Public follow view** | Watch a tournament without being in it |
| **Venue picker on tournament creation** | `p_venue_id` is always null today, so every tournament made in the app is the open tier. A club tournament needs the picker and staff rights at that venue |
| **Real content for 404, privacy policy, terms** | Stubs of 42–49 bytes |

---

## 5. Decisions needed from UV

Work is blocked or will be built wrong without these.

| Question | Why it is not Claude's call |
|---|---|
| Does a coordinator's rejection need a reason? | A dispute does. A rejection currently requires one in the function; confirm that is wanted |
| What does the coordinator's approval queue screen look like? | No design yet |
| Should an unpublished result be marked as pending in a player's own view? | Affects the match page and the match list |
| Travelling leagues: does a league have an owning venue, or its own fee scope? | Blocks entry fee charging |
| Shot clock and extension rules the timer hardware reads | Hardware is not specified |
| Captains inviting players to their team | UV, 22 Oct: common practice in existing leagues; to be discussed later. For now the director adds players (mid-season too) and a captain claims them once they have confirmed |

---

## 6. Known gaps and rough edges

Real, small, and none of them blocking.

| | Area |
|---|---|
| **`tbl_tournament_entrants` can be read directly by any signed-in player** | `paid_at` and the TD's `notes` come back from the API with no function in the way. The 21 Oct gate on `tdc_tournament_entrants` closed the function, not the table: the `select … using (true)` policy and grant are still there. Found 22 Oct while building the league equivalent. The fix is a migration revoking the grant and dropping the policy, after checking no page selects from the table directly. Tournaments chat's area; not changed from the leagues chat |
| League pages not built yet | Per-season rule overrides, continuing a team from an earlier season, a venue picker, and a page to edit a league's own rules (`tdc_update_league` has no form). None blocks lineups |
| `strict_frame_order` is obeyed by the card only | The scorecard offers only the next unplayed frame when it is on. `/match/` does not know about it, which does not matter while `/match/` refuses team matches |
| **Deleting an account leaves an accountless league player** | `tbl_players.user_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so removing an auth user leaves the player row behind — still on any league's list, which is the one thing a league player may not be. The trigger that enforces it is insert-only on purpose (the walk-in merge needs that). Found 23 Oct while writing the dummy-player cleanup. Unlikely but real; the fix is either a cascade or a nightly check |
| **The 23 version 1 ruleset keys are not type-checked** | `private.tdc_check_match_rules` checks that the keys are present and that the enumerated values are known, but never that `win_condition_target` is a number or `draws_allowed` a boolean. The two version 2 keys added 22 Oct are checked; the older ones are a job of their own. The design note calls this jsonb quietly becoming an unvalidated config format the heaviest standing risk in the system |
| **Nothing tells the players the fixtures are out** | Generating notifies nobody on purpose (`docs/DECISIONS.md`): a fresh schedule is the director's working document and regenerating it is ordinary. Telling them should be a separate act, as sharing a tournament poster is. Not built |
| The team card records a winner, not how they won | `/leagues/card/` enters winner-only. Break detail, break & finish and the rest are on `/match/`, which refuses a team match — so on a league night those are unreachable. Fine for a club night; a nationals night that tracks breaks would want them |
| `tdc_remove_league_entrant` removes anyone | Fine while there are no fixtures. Once there are, it should refuse for a player who has played — as `tdc_remove_entrant` should have |
| Settings writes are still last-write-wins | Frames are guarded, settings are not |
| The match list and nav are not live | Everything else is |
| A future fixture does not read as upcoming in the match list | |
| No audit log for staff linking walk-ins | Frames have one; this does not |
| `referee` is marked `stored: false` with no column | It lives only on the screen it is typed on |
| PWA icons are still the old silver artwork | `src/resources/icons/*` |
| Email assets are pre-refresh | `email-wordmark.png`, `email-dive.gif` |
| Duplicate light/dark SVGs are byte-identical | `logo-mark-*`, `logo-primary-*`. One of each is redundant, or one was never made |
| `hero.jpg` and `social-share.jpg` are 0 bytes | Referenced, empty |

## 7. How this document is kept

- **One list, not several.** Before adding an outstanding item anywhere else, add it here instead.
- **Date anything that could go stale.** A line without a date is read as current.
- **Move, do not copy.** An item that is done comes out of this document; if the reasoning is worth keeping it goes to `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and if it is a built system it goes to `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Re-stage before every edit, and know which branch the repo is on.** This file is written by both chats and by several steps of one session. A copy staged ten minutes ago is already stale, and committing it silently reverts whatever landed in between — which happened twice on 22 Oct, both times putting a finished item back on the list. A delivery into a working tree mid-branch-switch also caused an autostash conflict the same day; ask before writing if the last message was not a plain "done".
- **This file is the agenda. `CLAUDE.md` is the record. `docs/DECISIONS.md` is the why.** Three files, three jobs, no overlap.
- **The long backlog is `claude/stats-todo.md`** in the project — someday work, the schema still to come, deferred refinements. The split: if it is active, blocked, or waiting on UV it belongs here; if it is someday, it belongs there. When something there becomes active, **move** it here rather than copying it.
