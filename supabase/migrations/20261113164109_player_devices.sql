-- Which devices and browsers each player uses, and whether as the installed
-- app (UV, 13 Nov; docs/systems/foundations.md, "Getting the app").
--
-- UV wants players guided to install the app, and the points to count using
-- it (docs/design/points-and-tiers.md lists app installs as data that cannot
-- be recovered later). The nav sends one record a day per device, browser and
-- app-or-not while somebody is signed in (scripts/nav.js, tdc_record_device).
-- Nothing is recorded for a visitor who is not signed in.
--
-- One row per player and (os, browser, installed): when it was first and last
-- seen, and on how many days (Johannesburg days). The values come from the
-- browser's user agent (scripts/device.js), so they are a guide, not proof.
--
-- Private: no grants and no policies. Read in the SQL editor for now; the
-- points engine will read it from a function when that is built.
--
-- A new table referencing tbl_players, so private.tdc_merge_players carries it
-- (CLAUDE.md, idea 9). The foreign-key query from 20261024090641, run on a
-- fresh local copy on 13 Nov, gave 26 references, every one already handled,
-- before this table added its one. Patched from the definition as of
-- 20261105205913, extracted from that copy and diffed: one block added before
-- the signup record is deleted.
