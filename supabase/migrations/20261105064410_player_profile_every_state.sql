-- A player's matches in every state (UV, 5 Nov).
--
-- The player page's match lists (Competitions: Leagues and Tournaments;
-- Recent matches) show each match's state as a strip, as the league
-- fixtures do: not started, playing, finished, abandoned. Until now
-- tdc_player_profile returned finished matches only, so every strip would
-- have been the same. It now returns every match the player is in, each with
-- its status, while what is counted is unchanged: 'frames' still holds only
-- finished frames of finished matches, and the page counts its stats from
-- finished matches alone.
--
-- Who is "in" a match, in any state:
--   - the frames they are in (as before), which also covers a team night
--     once both lineups lock, since the lock creates the frames;
--   - a singles match naming them as home or away, before any frame;
--   - a team night's squad (who is available tonight) before the lock
--     (UV: show a league night once they are in their team's lineup). The
--     squad is open to read; the order is a blind exchange until both sides
--     lock (tdc_match_lineup), so it is never read here, or the profile would
--     tell an opponent who is playing before the lock.
--
-- Patched from 20261105044302 (copied, not retyped): in_match takes the
-- three sources, counted keeps every status and carries it, matches gain
-- 'status', and frames keep only finished matches. tdc_head_to_head is
-- unchanged: meetings are finished matches, as before.
