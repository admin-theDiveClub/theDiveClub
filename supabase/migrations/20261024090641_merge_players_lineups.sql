-- The walk-in merge keeps tonight's squad, the lineup and the notification
-- settings.
--
-- Audit item A5 (docs/STATUS.md, 23 Oct).
--
-- private.tdc_merge_players names every table that references tbl_players
-- (principle 9). Three were missing. Played out locally: a league player in
-- tonight's squad at position 1, with league notifications off, whose old
-- walk-in record staff then linked to their account, came out of it
--   • out of the squad      (tbl_league_match_squad cascades on delete),
--   • with position 1 empty (tbl_league_match_order is set null),
--   • with league notifications back on (tbl_notification_prefs cascades).
-- All three now move with everything else.
--
-- A walk-in has no account, so it can have no settings and cannot be a
-- league player, which squads and lineups need. A clash can only come from a
-- direct write. If one happens, the account's row stands and the walk-in's
-- goes (UV, 24 Oct), so a merge never fails on a duplicate key here.
--
-- The foreign-key query from 20261014170000, run on 24 Oct on a fresh local
-- copy and on production (read-only), gave the same 22 references. Every one
-- is now handled here, except tbl_players.guest_of_player_id, which is moved
-- at the top, and tbl_player_identifiers, which cascades and is moved anyway.
-- No migration of 24 Oct added a player-referencing table, and no uuid column
-- names a player without a foreign key. Run it again rather than trusting
-- this list:
--
--   select c.conrelid::regclass as from_table, a.attname, c.confdeltype
--   from pg_constraint c
--   join unnest(c.conkey) with ordinality as k(attnum, ord) on true
--   join pg_attribute a on a.attrelid = c.conrelid and a.attnum = k.attnum
--   where c.contype = 'f' and c.confrelid = 'public.tbl_players'::regclass;
--
-- Patched from the definition as of 20261022190000, extracted from a freshly
-- reset local database. Not callable from the API, before or after.
