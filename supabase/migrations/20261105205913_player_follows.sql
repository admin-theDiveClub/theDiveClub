-- Following a player, on the player page (UV, 5 Nov; docs/systems/players.md).
--
-- Settled with UV the same day:
--   - One-way, no approval: tap Follow and it is done.
--   - Private: only you can see who you follow. No follower lists or counts,
--     for anybody, so nobody is told either. It can be opened up later; once
--     people have seen who follows whom it cannot be taken back.
--
-- So nothing here can answer "who follows this player". The table has no
-- grants and no policies, and the one read answers only for the person asking.
--
-- A new table referencing tbl_players (twice), so private.tdc_merge_players
-- carries it (CLAUDE.md, idea 9). The foreign-key query from 20261024090641,
-- run on a fresh reset on 5 Nov, gave 24 references, every one already handled,
-- before this table added its two. Patched from the definition as of
-- 20261105153021, extracted from that reset and diffed: one block added before
-- the signup record is deleted.
